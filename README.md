# WeatherProject: Deploying a Python Web Application on AWS with Kubernetes and CI/CD

## Project Overview

This project aims to deploy a Python web application on AWS using Docker containers managed by Kubernetes. Jenkins will be utilized for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). Git will be used for version control, while Terraform and Ansible will handle infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.

## Steps

1. **Setup AWS Account**:
   - Generate access key and secret key.

2. **Install Required Tools**:
   - Install Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Git, Bash, Terraform, and Ansible on your local machine or a dedicated server.

3. **Setup Git Repository**:
   - Create a Git repository to store your project code.
   - Initialize the repository with a README.md file and a .gitignore file.

4. **Develop Python Web Application**:
   - Weather Forecast Application using OpenWeatherMap API:
     - Step 1: Setup Flask Environment
     - Step 2: Define Routes
     - Step 3: External API Integration

5. **Dockerize the Application**:
   - Write a Dockerfile to package your Python application into a Docker container.
   - Build the Docker image locally and test it.
   - Tag the Docker image with a version and push it to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) or DockerHub.

6. **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform**:
   - Write Terraform configuration files to provision necessary AWS resources (VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, EKS Cluster, etc.).
   - Initialize Terraform, plan, and apply the infrastructure changes.
   - Verify that all resources are provisioned correctly.

7. **Configure Kubernetes with kubectl**:
   - Configure kubectl to connect to your AWS EKS cluster (minikube, EKS, kops).
   - Deploy Kubernetes resources (Deployment, Service, Ingress, etc.) for your Python application.

8. **Setup Jenkins Pipeline**:
   - Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins (Pipeline, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).
   - Create a Jenkins pipeline to automate CI/CD tasks.
   - Define stages in the pipeline such as build, test, deploy, etc.
   - Integrate Git repository with Jenkins for automatic triggering of builds.

9. **Implement Continuous Integration**:
   - Configure Jenkins to pull code from the Git repository.
   - Build the Docker image, run tests, and generate artifacts.
   - Integrate unit tests and linting into the CI pipeline.

10. **Implement Continuous Deployment**:
    - Configure Jenkins to deploy the Docker image to EKS after successful build and tests.
    - Use Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for deployment configurations.
    - Implement canary or blue-green deployment strategies for rolling updates.

11. **Setup Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Utilize AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, or ELK stack for monitoring and logging.
    - Monitor application performance, resource utilization, and container health.
    - Set up alerts for critical events and thresholds.

12. **Implement Infrastructure Configuration Management with Ansible**:
    - Write Ansible playbooks to configure Kubernetes nodes, install dependencies, etc.
    - Integrate Ansible tasks into the Jenkins pipeline for infrastructure provisioning and management.

13. **Security and Access Management**:
    - Implement IAM roles and policies to restrict access to AWS resources.
    - Configure security groups, network policies, and RBAC in Kubernetes.
    - Secure sensitive information like AWS credentials and application secrets.

14. **Documentation and Training**:
    - Document the project architecture, setup instructions, and troubleshooting guidelines.
    - You can use tools like draw.io or cloudcraft.io for creating architecture diagrams.
